# Privacy Policy for Bude Global Tech Presentations

**Last Updated: November 4, 2025**

Bude Global Enterprise ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Bude Global Tech Presentations repository (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

We want to make it clear: **The Bude Global Tech Presentations platform itself does NOT directly collect any personal data from its users.**

Our Service is a static website designed to display technical presentations. We do not implement user accounts, forms, or any features that would require us to collect personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, or payment details.

### Usage Data

We may collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Service ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

This Usage Data is collected for the sole purpose of understanding general traffic patterns and improving the performance and accessibility of our Service. It is aggregated and anonymized, and we do not attempt to identify individual users from this data.

## 2. Tracking & Cookies Data

We do NOT use cookies or similar tracking technologies to track activity on our Service or store any personal information.

However, please note that third-party services (e.g., GitHub Pages hosting, external CDN for Reveal.js, Google Fonts, Remixicon) might use their own cookies or tracking mechanisms. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party providers for more information.

## 3. Use of Data

Bude Global Enterprise uses the collected Usage Data for various purposes:

*   To provide and maintain the Service
*   To monitor the usage of the Service
*   To detect, prevent, and address technical issues
*   To improve the user experience and content relevance

## 4. Data Retention

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no personal data to retain. Anonymized Usage Data may be retained indefinitely for analytical purposes.

## 5. Transfer of Data

Your information, including Usage Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those from your jurisdiction.

Bude Global Enterprise will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.

## 6. Disclosure of Data

We do not disclose any personal data as we do not collect it. Anonymized Usage Data may be shared with analytics providers to help us understand traffic patterns.

## 7. Security of Data

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Usage Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 8. Your Data Protection Rights

As we do not collect personal data, there are no specific data protection rights (e.g., access, rectification, erasure) that apply directly to personal data held by us. However, you may have rights regarding the Usage Data collected by third-party services.

## 9. Links to Other Sites

Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## 10. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
